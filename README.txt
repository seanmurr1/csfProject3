Part (b): Best cache, contributions
Write back and no write allocate is not a possible combination so this is defnitely not the best overall cache configuration.
TODO:
Test with
Write back and write allocate
Write through and no write allocate
Write through and write allocate
and for each one should probably test direct-mapped, set-associative, and fully associative caches for each one. 
and maybe paste the actual output for each one with the command line input? should we test with different trace files?
Text me either way? I won't be back until late monday but if you want to lmk what you think 
    and mb give the different cache sizes to run w each of the configurations I can run it all and finish the
    write up?
